# Physgun Guides Contribution Guidelines

We want to keep everything simple and easy to understand while also being informative. Below you'll be-able to find guidelines for content, references, language, curation process, and rewards.

You can also find the step by step guide on how to contribute!

# General Guidelines

## Content
- **No copy-pasta**
   - We simply ask that you do not copy-and-paste guides that originate elsewhere. However if you believe you can write a better more understanding guide that already exists you are more than welcome to.
- **Ensure the guide does not exist on https://help.physgun.com**
  - Please ensure you are not posting guides that already exist on the community guide database. You can use the search feature to confirm that one has not already been made.
- **Write with purpose**
  - These guides should provide value to the reader, not slop. We're trying to help better the community by providing informative context in a digestable setting. Please do not just blindly paste commands/actions in, give them short and informative explanations.

## References, External Sources
- **Links & External Sources**
  - Please ensure if you are linking outside of Physgun that you link to a safe and trusted url. Untrusted urls will be rejected immediately.
  - Please do not link to guides outside of Physgun, if they have contextual clues you can write them in your own form instead!

## Language
- **English & Other Languages**
  - We are primarily looking for English entries, however if you are **fluent** in other languages and wish to submit guides in another language you may feel free. However you must have a copy primarily in English.
  - If you are not a fluent English speaker please feel free to reachout to us in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/physgun) if you have amazing guides, we'll look into working with you to produce them!
- **Be Easily Understandable**
  - These guides will be used by a wide variety of Server Owners & Developers. Some may be beginners so please ensure you are being informative and providing contextual assistance. Try thinking about what someone who has no idea what you're writing about is doing while they read your guide.
  - Please ensure you are talking normally without slang, some readers may not understand "ngl" or "tbh".
  - Jokes and personal nacks are fine, just don't over do it.

# The 2-step Curation Process

1. Once you submit your guide one of us here at Physgun will go over and review it and provide feedback.
2. When we no longer have anymore feedback to give your guide will more than likely be accepted and pushed into the database!

It's really that simple! We don't want to overcomplicate the curation process, all it needs is a simple review and format check.

*Please note if your guide request becomes inactive we will mark it as such, after a few days of being inactive the request will be closed. You can always re-submit a request after it has been closed!*
